<div id="Philemon1">
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:1</span> Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:2</span> And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house: 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:3</span> Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Philemon's Love and Faith
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:4</span> I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:5</span> Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:6</span> That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:7</span> For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. 
Paul's Plea for Onesimus
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:8</span> Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:9</span> Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:10</span> I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds: 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:11</span> Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me: 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:12</span> Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:13</span> Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:14</span> But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly. 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:15</span> For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever; 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:16</span> Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:17</span> If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:18</span> If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account; 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:19</span> I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides. 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:20</span> Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord. 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:21</span> Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say. 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:22</span> But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you. 
Final Greetings
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:23</span> There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus; 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:24</span> Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers. 
<p><span id="charse">Phm 1:25</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. Written from Rome to Philemon, by Onesimus a servant.
