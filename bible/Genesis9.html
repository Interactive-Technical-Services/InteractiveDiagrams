<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">Gen 9:2 </span> And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">Gen 9:3 </span> Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">Gen 9:4 </span> But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">Gen 9:5 </span> And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">Gen 9:6 </span> Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.

<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">Gen 9:8 </span> And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">Gen 9:9 </span> And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">Gen 9:10</span>  And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">Gen 9:11</span>  And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">Gen 9:12</span>  And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">Gen 9:13</span>  I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">Gen 9:14</span>  And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">Gen 9:15</span>  And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">Gen 9:16</span>  And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">Gen 9:20</span>  And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:

<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">Gen 9:22</span>  And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">Gen 9:23</span>  And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
