<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:2 </span> Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:3 </span> Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:4 </span> For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:5 </span> And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:6 </span> And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:7 </span> And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:8 </span> Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:9 </span> There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:10</span>  And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:11</span>  In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:12</span>  And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:13</span>  In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:14</span>  They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:15</span>  And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:16</span>  And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:17</span>  And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:18</span>  And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:19</span>  And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:20</span>  Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:21</span>  And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:22</span>  All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:23</span>  And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark. 
<br><br><span class = "chapterVerse">7:24</span>  And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
