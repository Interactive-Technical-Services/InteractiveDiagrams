  <p><span id="charse">Gen 12:4 </span> So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran. 
  <p><span id="charse">Gen 12:5 </span> And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. 
  <p><span id="charse">Gen 12:6 </span> And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. 
  <p><span id="charse">Gen 12:7 </span> And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him. 
  <p><span id="charse">Gen 12:8 </span> And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD. 
  <p><span id="charse">Gen 12:9 </span> And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. 
  Abram and Sarai in Egypt
  <p><span id="charse">Gen 12:10</span>  And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land. 
  <p><span id="charse">Gen 12:11</span>  And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon: 
  <p><span id="charse">Gen 12:12</span>  Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. 
  <p><span id="charse">Gen 12:13</span>  Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee. 
  <p><span id="charse">Gen 12:14</span>  And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. 
  <p><span id="charse">Gen 12:15</span>  The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. 
  <p><span id="charse">Gen 12:16</span>  And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels. 
  <p><span id="charse">Gen 12:17</span>  And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife. 
  <p><span id="charse">Gen 12:18</span>  And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? 
  <p><span id="charse">Gen 12:19</span>  Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way. 
  <p><span id="charse">Gen 12:20</span>  And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.

  <p><span id="charse">Gen 13:5 </span> And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. 
  <p><span id="charse">Gen 13:6 </span> And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. 
  <p><span id="charse">Gen 13:7 </span> And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.

  <p><span id="charse">Gen 13:11</span>  Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.

  <p><span id="charse">Gen 13:13</span>  But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly. 
  <p><span id="charse">Gen 13:14</span>  And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:

God's Covenant with Abram
<p><span id="charse">Gen 15:1 </span> After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.

Abraham and the Covenant of Circumcision
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:1 </span> And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:2 </span> And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.

<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:4 </span> As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:5 </span> Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:6 </span> And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:7 </span> And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:8 </span> And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:9 </span> And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:10</span>  This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:11</span>  And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:12</span>  And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:13</span>  He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:14</span>  And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant. 
Isaac's Birth Promised
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:15</span>  And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:16</span>  And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:17</span>  Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:18</span>  And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee! 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:19</span>  And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:20</span>  And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:21</span>  But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:22</span>  And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:23</span>  And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:24</span>  And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:25</span>  And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:26</span>  In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 17:27</span>  And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him. 

<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:1 </span> And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:2 </span> And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:3 </span> And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:4 </span> Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:5 </span> And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:6 </span> And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:7 </span> And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:8 </span> And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:9 </span> And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:10</span>  And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:11</span>  Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:12</span>  Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:13</span>  And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:14</span>  Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:15</span>  Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:16</span>  And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:17</span>  And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:18</span>  Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:19</span>  For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:20</span>  And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:21</span>  I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know. 
Abraham Intercedes for Sodom
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:22</span>  And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:23</span>  And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:24</span>  Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:25</span>  That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:26</span>  And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:27</span>  And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:28</span>  Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:29</span>  And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:30</span>  And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:31</span>  And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:32</span>  And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 18:33</span>  And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place. 

God Rescues Lot
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:1 </span> And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:2 </span> And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:3 </span> And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:4 </span> But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:5 </span> And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:6 </span> And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:7 </span> And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:8 </span> Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:9 </span> And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:10</span>  But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:11</span>  And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:12</span>  And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:13</span>  For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:14</span>  And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:15</span>  And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:16</span>  And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:17</span>  And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:18</span>  And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:19</span>  Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:20</span>  Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:21</span>  And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:22</span>  Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. 
God Destroys Sodom
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:23</span>  The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:24</span>  Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:25</span>  And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:26</span>  But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:27</span>  And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:28</span>  And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:29</span>  And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt. 
Lot and His Daughters
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:30</span>  And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:31</span>  And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:32</span>  Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:33</span>  And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:34</span>  And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:35</span>  And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:36</span>  Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:37</span>  And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 19:38</span>  And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day. 

Abraham and Abimelech
<p><span id="charse">Gen 20:1 </span> And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 20:2 </span> And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 20:3 </span> But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 20:4 </span> But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 20:5 </span> Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 20:6 </span> And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 20:7 </span> Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 20:8 </span> Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 20:9 </span> Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 20:10</span>  And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 20:11</span>  And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 20:12</span>  And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 20:13</span>  And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 20:14</span>  And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 20:15</span>  And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 20:16</span>  And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 20:17</span>  So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 20:18</span>  For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife. 

The Birth of Isaac
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:1 </span> And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:2 </span> For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:3 </span> And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:4 </span> And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:5 </span> And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:6 </span> And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:7 </span> And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age. 
God Protects Hagar and Ishmael
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:8 </span> And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:9 </span> And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:10</span>  Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:11</span>  And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:12</span>  And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:13</span>  And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:14</span>  And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:15</span>  And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:16</span>  And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:17</span>  And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:18</span>  Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:19</span>  And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:20</span>  And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:21</span>  And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. 
A Treaty with Abimelech
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:22</span>  And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:23</span>  Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:24</span>  And Abraham said, I will swear. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:25</span>  And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:26</span>  And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:27</span>  And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:28</span>  And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:29</span>  And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:30</span>  And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:31</span>  Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:32</span>  Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:33</span>  And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 21:34</span>  And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days. 

The Sacrifice of Isaac
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:1 </span> And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:2 </span> And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:3 </span> And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:4 </span> Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:5 </span> And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:6 </span> And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:7 </span> And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:8 </span> And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:9 </span> And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:10</span>  And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:11</span>  And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:12</span>  And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:13</span>  And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:14</span>  And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:15</span>  And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:16</span>  And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:17</span>  That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:18</span>  And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:19</span>  So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:20</span>  And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:21</span>  Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:22</span>  And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:23</span>  And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 22:24</span>  And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah. 

Sarah's Death and Burial
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:1 </span> And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:2 </span> And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:3 </span> And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:4 </span> I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:5 </span> And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:6 </span> Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:7 </span> And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:8 </span> And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:9 </span> That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:10</span>  And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:11</span>  Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:12</span>  And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:13</span>  And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:14</span>  And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:15</span>  My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:16</span>  And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:17</span>  And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:18</span>  Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:19</span>  And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 23:20</span>  And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth. 

Isaac and Rebekah
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:1 </span> And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:2 </span> And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:3 </span> And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:4 </span> But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:5 </span> And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:6 </span> And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:7 </span> The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:8 </span> And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:9 </span> And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:10</span>  And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:11</span>  And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:12</span>  And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:13</span>  Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:14</span>  And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:15</span>  And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:16</span>  And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:17</span>  And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:18</span>  And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:19</span>  And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:20</span>  And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:21</span>  And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:22</span>  And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:23</span>  And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:24</span>  And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:25</span>  She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:26</span>  And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:27</span>  And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:28</span>  And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:29</span>  And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:30</span>  And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:31</span>  And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:32</span>  And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:33</span>  And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:34</span>  And he said, I am Abraham's servant. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:35</span>  And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:36</span>  And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:37</span>  And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:38</span>  But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:39</span>  And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:40</span>  And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:41</span>  Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:42</span>  And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:43</span>  Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:44</span>  And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:45</span>  And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:46</span>  And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:47</span>  And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:48</span>  And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:49</span>  And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:50</span>  Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:51</span>  Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:52</span>  And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:53</span>  And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:54</span>  And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:55</span>  And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:56</span>  And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:57</span>  And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:58</span>  And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:59</span>  And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:60</span>  And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:61</span>  And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:62</span>  And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:63</span>  And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:64</span>  And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:65</span>  For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:66</span>  And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 24:67</span>  And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death. 
Abraham's Death and His Descendants
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:1 </span> Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:2 </span> And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:3 </span> And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:4 </span> And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:5 </span> And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:6 </span> But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:7 </span> And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:8 </span> Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:9 </span> And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:10</span>  The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:11</span>  And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:12</span>  Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:13</span>  And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:14</span>  And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:15</span>  Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:16</span>  These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:17</span>  And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:18</span>  And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren. 
The Birth of Esau and Jacob
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:19</span>  And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:20</span>  And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:21</span>  And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:22</span>  And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:23</span>  And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:24</span>  And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:25</span>  And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:26</span>  And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:27</span>  And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:28</span>  And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob. 
Esau Sells His Birthright
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:29</span>  And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:30</span>  And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:31</span>  And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:32</span>  And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:33</span>  And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 25:34</span>  Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright. 

God's Promise to Isaac
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:1 </span> And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:2 </span> And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:3 </span> Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:4 </span> And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:5 </span> Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. 
Isaac and Abimelech
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:6 </span> And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:7 </span> And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:8 </span> And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:9 </span> And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:10</span>  And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:11</span>  And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:12</span>  Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:13</span>  And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:14</span>  For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:15</span>  For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:16</span>  And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:17</span>  And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:18</span>  And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:19</span>  And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:20</span>  And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:21</span>  And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:22</span>  And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:23</span>  And he went up from thence to Beersheba. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:24</span>  And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:25</span>  And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:26</span>  Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:27</span>  And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:28</span>  And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:29</span>  That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:30</span>  And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:31</span>  And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:32</span>  And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:33</span>  And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:34</span>  And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 26:35</span>  Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah. 

Isaac Blesses Jacob
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:1 </span> And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:2 </span> And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:3 </span> Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:4 </span> And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:5 </span> And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:6 </span> And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:7 </span> Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:8 </span> Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:9 </span> Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:10</span>  And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:11</span>  And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:12</span>  My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:13</span>  And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:14</span>  And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:15</span>  And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:16</span>  And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:17</span>  And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:18</span>  And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:19</span>  And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:20</span>  And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:21</span>  And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:22</span>  And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:23</span>  And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:24</span>  And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:25</span>  And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:26</span>  And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:27</span>  And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:28</span>  Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:29</span>  Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:30</span>  And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:31</span>  And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:32</span>  And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:33</span>  And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:34</span>  And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:35</span>  And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:36</span>  And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:37</span>  And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:38</span>  And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:39</span>  And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:40</span>  And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:41</span>  And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:42</span>  And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:43</span>  Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:44</span>  And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:45</span>  Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 27:46</span>  And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me? 

Jacob Sent to Laban
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:1 </span> And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:2 </span> Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:3 </span> And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:4 </span> And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:5 </span> And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother. 
Esau Marries an Ishmaelite
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:6 </span> When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:7 </span> And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:8 </span> And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:9 </span> Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife. 
Jacob's Dream
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:10</span>  And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:11</span>  And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:12</span>  And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:13</span>  And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:14</span>  And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:15</span>  And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:16</span>  And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:17</span>  And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:18</span>  And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:19</span>  And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:20</span>  And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:21</span>  So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 28:22</span>  And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee. 

Jacob Marries Leah and Rachel
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:1 </span> Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:2 </span> And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:3 </span> And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:4 </span> And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:5 </span> And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:6 </span> And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:7 </span> And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:8 </span> And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:9 </span> And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:10</span>  And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:11</span>  And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:12</span>  And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:13</span>  And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:14</span>  And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:15</span>  And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:16</span>  And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:17</span>  Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:18</span>  And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:19</span>  And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:20</span>  And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:21</span>  And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:22</span>  And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:23</span>  And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:24</span>  And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:25</span>  And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:26</span>  And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:27</span>  Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:28</span>  And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:29</span>  And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:30</span>  And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years. 
Jacob's Children
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:31</span>  And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:32</span>  And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:33</span>  And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:34</span>  And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 29:35</span>  And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing. 

<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:1 </span> And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:2 </span> And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:3 </span> And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:4 </span> And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:5 </span> And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:6 </span> And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:7 </span> And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:8 </span> And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:9 </span> When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:10</span>  And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:11</span>  And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:12</span>  And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:13</span>  And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:14</span>  And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:15</span>  And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:16</span>  And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:17</span>  And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:18</span>  And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:19</span>  And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:20</span>  And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:21</span>  And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:22</span>  And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:23</span>  And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:24</span>  And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son. 
Jacob's Prosperity
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:25</span>  And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:26</span>  Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:27</span>  And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:28</span>  And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:29</span>  And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:30</span>  For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:31</span>  And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:32</span>  I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:33</span>  So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:34</span>  And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:35</span>  And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:36</span>  And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:37</span>  And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:38</span>  And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:39</span>  And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:40</span>  And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:41</span>  And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:42</span>  But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 30:43</span>  And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses. 

Jacob Flees from Laban
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:1 </span> And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:2 </span> And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:3 </span> And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:4 </span> And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:5 </span> And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:6 </span> And ye know that with all my power I have served your father. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:7 </span> And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:8 </span> If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:9 </span> Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:10</span>  And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:11</span>  And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:12</span>  And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:13</span>  I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:14</span>  And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:15</span>  Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:16</span>  For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:17</span>  Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:18</span>  And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:19</span>  And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:20</span>  And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:21</span>  So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:22</span>  And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:23</span>  And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:24</span>  And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:25</span>  Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:26</span>  And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:27</span>  Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:28</span>  And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:29</span>  It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:30</span>  And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:31</span>  And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:32</span>  With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:33</span>  And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:34</span>  Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:35</span>  And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:36</span>  And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:37</span>  Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:38</span>  This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:39</span>  That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:40</span>  Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:41</span>  Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:42</span>  Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:43</span>  And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:44</span>  Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:45</span>  And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:46</span>  And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:47</span>  And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:48</span>  And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:49</span>  And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:50</span>  If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:51</span>  And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:52</span>  This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:53</span>  The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:54</span>  Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 31:55</span>  And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place. 

Jacob Fears Esau
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:1 </span> And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:2 </span> And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:3 </span> And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:4 </span> And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:5 </span> And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:6 </span> And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:7 </span> Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:8 </span> And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:9 </span> And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:10</span>  I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:11</span>  Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:12</span>  And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:13</span>  And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:14</span>  Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:15</span>  Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:16</span>  And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:17</span>  And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:18</span>  Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:19</span>  And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:20</span>  And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:21</span>  So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company. 
Jacob Wrestles with God
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:22</span>  And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:23</span>  And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:24</span>  And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:25</span>  And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:26</span>  And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:27</span>  And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:28</span>  And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:29</span>  And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:30</span>  And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:31</span>  And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 32:32</span>  Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank. 

Jacob Meets Esau
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:1 </span> And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:2 </span> And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:3 </span> And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:4 </span> And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:5 </span> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:6 </span> Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:7 </span> And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:8 </span> And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:9 </span> And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:10</span>  And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:11</span>  Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:12</span>  And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:13</span>  And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:14</span>  Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:15</span>  And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:16</span>  So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:17</span>  And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:18</span>  And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:19</span>  And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 33:20</span>  And he erected there an altar, and called it Elelohe-Israel. 

The Defiling of Dinah
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:1 </span> And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:2 </span> And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:3 </span> And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:4 </span> And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:5 </span> And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:6 </span> And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:7 </span> And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:8 </span> And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:9 </span> And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:10</span>  And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:11</span>  And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:12</span>  Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:13</span>  And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:14</span>  And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:15</span>  But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:16</span>  Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:17</span>  But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:18</span>  And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:19</span>  And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:20</span>  And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:21</span>  These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:22</span>  Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:23</span>  Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:24</span>  And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:25</span>  And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:26</span>  And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:27</span>  The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:28</span>  They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:29</span>  And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:30</span>  And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 34:31</span>  And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot? 

God Blesses and Renames Jacob
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:1 </span> And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:2 </span> Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:3 </span> And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:4 </span> And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:5 </span> And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:6 </span> So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:7 </span> And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:8 </span> But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:9 </span> And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:10</span>  And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:11</span>  And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:12</span>  And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:13</span>  And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:14</span>  And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:15</span>  And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel. 
The Deaths of Rachel and Isaac
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:16</span>  And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:17</span>  And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:18</span>  And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:19</span>  And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:20</span>  And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:21</span>  And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:22</span>  And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:23</span>  The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:24</span>  The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:25</span>  And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:26</span>  And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 35:27</span>  And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

<p><span id="charse">Gen 36:7 </span> For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.

Joseph's Dreams
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:1 </span> And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:2 </span> These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:3 </span> Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:4 </span> And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:5 </span> And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:6 </span> And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:7 </span> For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:8 </span> And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:9 </span> And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:10</span>  And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:11</span>  And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying. 
Joseph Sold by His Brothers
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:12</span>  And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:13</span>  And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:14</span>  And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:15</span>  And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:16</span>  And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:17</span>  And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:18</span>  And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:19</span>  And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:20</span>  Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:21</span>  And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:22</span>  And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:23</span>  And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:24</span>  And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:25</span>  And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:26</span>  And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:27</span>  Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:28</span>  Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:29</span>  And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:30</span>  And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:31</span>  And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:32</span>  And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:33</span>  And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:34</span>  And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:35</span>  And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 37:36</span>  And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard. 

Judah and Tamar
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:1 </span> And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:2 </span> And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:3 </span> And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:4 </span> And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:5 </span> And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:6 </span> And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:7 </span> And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:8 </span> And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:9 </span> And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:10</span>  And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:11</span>  Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:12</span>  And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:13</span>  And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:14</span>  And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:15</span>  When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:16</span>  And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:17</span>  And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:18</span>  And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:19</span>  And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:20</span>  And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:21</span>  Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:22</span>  And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:23</span>  And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:24</span>  And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:25</span>  When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:26</span>  And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:27</span>  And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:28</span>  And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:29</span>  And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 38:30</span>  And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah. 

Joseph and Potiphar's Wife
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:1 </span> And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:2 </span> And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:3 </span> And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:4 </span> And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:5 </span> And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:6 </span> And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:7 </span> And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:8 </span> But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:9 </span> There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:10</span>  And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:11</span>  And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:12</span>  And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:13</span>  And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:14</span>  That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:15</span>  And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:16</span>  And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:17</span>  And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:18</span>  And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:19</span>  And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:20</span>  And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:21</span>  But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:22</span>  And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 39:23</span>  The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper. 

Joseph Interprets Two Prisoners' Dreams
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:1 </span> And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:2 </span> And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:3 </span> And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:4 </span> And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:5 </span> And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:6 </span> And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:7 </span> And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:8 </span> And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:9 </span> And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:10</span>  And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:11</span>  And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:12</span>  And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:13</span>  Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:14</span>  But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:15</span>  For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:16</span>  When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:17</span>  And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:18</span>  And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:19</span>  Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:20</span>  And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:21</span>  And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:22</span>  But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 40:23</span>  Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him. 

Joseph Interprets Pharaoh's Dreams
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:1 </span> And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:2 </span> And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:3 </span> And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:4 </span> And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:5 </span> And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:6 </span> And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:7 </span> And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:8 </span> And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:9 </span> Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:10</span>  Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:11</span>  And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:12</span>  And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:13</span>  And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:14</span>  Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:15</span>  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:16</span>  And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:17</span>  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:18</span>  And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:19</span>  And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:20</span>  And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:21</span>  And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:22</span>  And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:23</span>  And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:24</span>  And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:25</span>  And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:26</span>  The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:27</span>  And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:28</span>  This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:29</span>  Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:30</span>  And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:31</span>  And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:32</span>  And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:33</span>  Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:34</span>  Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:35</span>  And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:36</span>  And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine. 
Joseph Rises to Power
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:37</span>  And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:38</span>  And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:39</span>  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:40</span>  Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:41</span>  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:42</span>  And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:43</span>  And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:44</span>  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:45</span>  And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:46</span>  And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:47</span>  And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:48</span>  And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:49</span>  And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:50</span>  And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:51</span>  And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:52</span>  And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:53</span>  And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:54</span>  And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:55</span>  And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:56</span>  And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 41:57</span>  And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands. 

Joseph's Brothers Go to Egypt
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:1 </span> Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:2 </span> And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:3 </span> And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:4 </span> But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:5 </span> And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:6 </span> And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:7 </span> And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:8 </span> And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:9 </span> And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:10</span>  And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:11</span>  We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:12</span>  And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:13</span>  And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:14</span>  And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:15</span>  Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:16</span>  Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:17</span>  And he put them all together into ward three days. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:18</span>  And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:19</span>  If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:20</span>  But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:21</span>  And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:22</span>  And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:23</span>  And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:24</span>  And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:25</span>  Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:26</span>  And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:27</span>  And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:28</span>  And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:29</span>  And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:30</span>  The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:31</span>  And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:32</span>  We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:33</span>  And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:34</span>  And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:35</span>  And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:36</span>  And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:37</span>  And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 42:38</span>  And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. 

Joseph's Brothers Return to Egypt
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:1 </span> And the famine was sore in the land. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:2 </span> And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:3 </span> And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:4 </span> If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:5 </span> But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:6 </span> And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:7 </span> And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:8 </span> And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:9 </span> I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:10</span>  For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:11</span>  And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:12</span>  And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:13</span>  Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:14</span>  And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:15</span>  And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:16</span>  And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:17</span>  And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:18</span>  And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:19</span>  And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:20</span>  And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:21</span>  And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:22</span>  And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:23</span>  And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:24</span>  And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:25</span>  And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:26</span>  And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:27</span>  And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:28</span>  And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:29</span>  And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:30</span>  And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:31</span>  And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:32</span>  And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:33</span>  And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 43:34</span>  And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him. 

Joseph Tests His Brothers
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:1 </span> And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:2 </span> And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:3 </span> As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:4 </span> And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:5 </span> Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:6 </span> And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:7 </span> And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:8 </span> Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:9 </span> With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:10</span>  And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:11</span>  Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:12</span>  And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:13</span>  Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:14</span>  And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:15</span>  And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:16</span>  And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:17</span>  And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:18</span>  Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:19</span>  My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:20</span>  And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:21</span>  And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:22</span>  And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:23</span>  And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:24</span>  And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:25</span>  And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:26</span>  And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:27</span>  And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:28</span>  And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:29</span>  And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:30</span>  Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:31</span>  It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:32</span>  For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:33</span>  Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 44:34</span>  For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father. 

Joseph Provides for His Brothers and Family
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:1 </span> Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:2 </span> And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:3 </span> And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:4 </span> And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:5 </span> Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:6 </span> For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:7 </span> And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:8 </span> So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:9 </span> Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:10</span>  And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:11</span>  And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:12</span>  And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:13</span>  And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:14</span>  And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:15</span>  Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:16</span>  And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:17</span>  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:18</span>  And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:19</span>  Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:20</span>  Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:21</span>  And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:22</span>  To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:23</span>  And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:24</span>  So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:25</span>  And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:26</span>  And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:27</span>  And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 45:28</span>  And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die. 

Joseph Brings His Family to Egypt
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:1 </span> And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:2 </span> And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:3 </span> And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:4 </span> I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:5 </span> And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:6 </span> And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:7 </span> His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:8 </span> And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:9 </span> And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:10</span>  And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:11</span>  And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:12</span>  And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zerah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:13</span>  And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:14</span>  And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:15</span>  These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:16</span>  And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:17</span>  And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:18</span>  These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:19</span>  The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:20</span>  And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:21</span>  And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:22</span>  These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:23</span>  And the sons of Dan; Hushim. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:24</span>  And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:25</span>  These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:26</span>  All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:27</span>  And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten. 
Jacob and Joseph Reunited
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:28</span>  And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:29</span>  And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:30</span>  And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:31</span>  And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:32</span>  And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:33</span>  And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 46:34</span>  That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians. 

Jacob's Family Settles in Goshen
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:1 </span> Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:2 </span> And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:3 </span> And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:4 </span> They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:5 </span> And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:6 </span> The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:7 </span> And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:8 </span> And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:9 </span> And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:10</span>  And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:11</span>  And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:12</span>  And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families. 
Joseph and the Famine
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:13</span>  And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:14</span>  And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:15</span>  And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:16</span>  And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:17</span>  And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:18</span>  When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:19</span>  Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:20</span>  And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:21</span>  And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:22</span>  Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:23</span>  Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:24</span>  And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:25</span>  And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:26</span>  And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:27</span>  And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:28</span>  And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:29</span>  And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:30</span>  But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 47:31</span>  And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head. 

Jacob Blesses Ephraim and Manasseh
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:1 </span> And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:2 </span> And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:3 </span> And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:4 </span> And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:5 </span> And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:6 </span> And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:7 </span> And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:8 </span> And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:9 </span> And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:10</span>  Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:11</span>  And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:12</span>  And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:13</span>  And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:14</span>  And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:15</span>  And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:16</span>  The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:17</span>  And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:18</span>  And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:19</span>  And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:20</span>  And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:21</span>  And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 48:22</span>  Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow. 

Jacob Blesses His Sons
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:1 </span> And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:2 </span> Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:3 </span> Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:4 </span> Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:5 </span> Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:6 </span> O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:7 </span> Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:8 </span> Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:9 </span> Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:10</span>  The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:11</span>  Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:12</span>  His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:13</span>  Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:14</span>  Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:15</span>  And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:16</span>  Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:17</span>  Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:18</span>  I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:19</span>  Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:20</span>  Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:21</span>  Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:22</span>  Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:23</span>  The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:24</span>  But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:) 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:25</span>  Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:26</span>  The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:27</span>  Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil. 
Jacob's Death and Burial
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:28</span>  All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:29</span>  And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:30</span>  In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:31</span>  There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:32</span>  The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 49:33</span>  And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people. 

<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:1 </span> And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:2 </span> And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:3 </span> And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:4 </span> And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:5 </span> My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:6 </span> And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:7 </span> And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:8 </span> And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:9 </span> And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:10</span>  And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:11</span>  And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:12</span>  And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:13</span>  For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:14</span>  And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. 
God's Good Purposes
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:15</span>  And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:16</span>  And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:17</span>  So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:18</span>  And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:19</span>  And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God? 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:20</span>  But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:21</span>  Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them. 
The Death of Joseph
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:22</span>  And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:23</span>  And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:24</span>  And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:25</span>  And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. 
<p><span id="charse">Gen 50:26</span>  So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

    <!-- Exodus -->

    Israel Increases Greatly in Egypt
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:1  </span>Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:2  </span>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:3  </span>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:4  </span>Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:5  </span>And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:6  </span>And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:7  </span>And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them. 
Pharaoh Oppresses Israel
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:8  </span>Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:9  </span>And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:10 </span> Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:11 </span> Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:12 </span> But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:13 </span> And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:14 </span> And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:15 </span> And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:16 </span> And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:17 </span> But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:18 </span> And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:19 </span> And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:20 </span> Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:21 </span> And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 1:22 </span> And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive. 

The Birth of Moses
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:1  </span>And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:2  </span>And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:3  </span>And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:4  </span>And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:5  </span>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:6  </span>And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:7  </span>Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:8  </span>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:9  </span>And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:10 </span> And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. 
Moses Flees to Midian
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:11 </span> And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:12 </span> And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:13 </span> And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:14 </span> And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:15 </span> Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:16 </span> Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:17 </span> And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:18 </span> And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:19 </span> And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:20 </span> And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:21 </span> And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:22 </span> And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land. 
God Hears Israel's Groaning
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:23 </span> And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:24 </span> And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 2:25 </span> And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them. 
The Burning Bush
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:1  </span>Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:2  </span>And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:3  </span>And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:4  </span>And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:5  </span>And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:6  </span>Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:7  </span>And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:8  </span>And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:9  </span>Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:10 </span> Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:11 </span> And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:12 </span> And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:13 </span> And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:14 </span> And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:15 </span> And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:16 </span> Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:17 </span> And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:18 </span> And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:19 </span> And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:20 </span> And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:21 </span> And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 3:22 </span> But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians. 

Moses Given Powerful Signs
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:1  </span>And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:2  </span>And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:3  </span>And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:4  </span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:5  </span>That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:6  </span>And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:7  </span>And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:8  </span>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:9  </span>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:10 </span> And Moses said unto the LORD, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:11 </span> And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:12 </span> Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:13 </span> And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:14 </span> And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:15 </span> And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:16 </span> And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:17 </span> And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs. 
Moses Returns to Egypt
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:18 </span> And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:19 </span> And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:20 </span> And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:21 </span> And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:22 </span> And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:23 </span> And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:24 </span> And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:25 </span> Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:26 </span> So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:27 </span> And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:28 </span> And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:29 </span> And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:30 </span> And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 4:31 </span> And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped. 

Making Bricks Without Straw
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:1  </span>And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:2  </span>And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:3  </span>And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:4  </span>And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:5  </span>And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:6  </span>And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:7  </span>Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:8  </span>And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:9  </span>Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:10 </span> And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:11 </span> Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:12 </span> So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:13 </span> And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:14 </span> And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:15 </span> Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:16 </span> There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:17 </span> But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:18 </span> Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:19 </span> And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:20 </span> And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:21 </span> And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:22 </span> And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 5:23 </span> For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all. 

God Promises Deliverance
<p><span id="charse">Exo 6:1  </span>Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 6:2  </span>And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 6:3  </span>And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 6:4  </span>And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 6:5  </span>And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 6:6  </span>Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 6:7  </span>And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 6:8  </span>And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 6:9  </span>And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 6:10 </span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 6:11 </span> Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 6:12 </span> And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 6:13 </span> And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

<p><span id="charse">Exo 6:28 </span> And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 6:29 </span> That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 6:30 </span> And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me? 

Moses and Aaron Before Pharaoh
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:1  </span>And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:2  </span>Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:3  </span>And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:4  </span>But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:5  </span>And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:6  </span>And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:7  </span>And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:8  </span>And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:9  </span>When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:10 </span> And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:11 </span> Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:12 </span> For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:13 </span> And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. 
The First Plague: Water Turned to Blood
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:14 </span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:15 </span> Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:16 </span> And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:17 </span> Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:18 </span> And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:19 </span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:20 </span> And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:21 </span> And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:22 </span> And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:23 </span> And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:24 </span> And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 7:25 </span> And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river. 

The Second Plague: Frogs
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:1  </span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:2  </span>And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:3  </span>And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:4  </span>And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:5  </span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:6  </span>And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:7  </span>And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:8  </span>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:9  </span>And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:10 </span> And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:11 </span> And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:12 </span> And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:13 </span> And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:14 </span> And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:15 </span> But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. 
The Third Plague: Gnats
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:16 </span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:17 </span> And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:18 </span> And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:19 </span> Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. 
The Fourth Plague: Flies
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:20 </span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:21 </span> Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:22 </span> And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:23 </span> And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:24 </span> And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:25 </span> And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:26 </span> And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:27 </span> We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:28 </span> And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:29 </span> And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:30 </span> And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:31 </span> And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 8:32 </span> And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go. 

The Fifth Plague: Egyptian Livestock Die
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:1  </span>Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:2  </span>For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:3  </span>Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:4  </span>And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:5  </span>And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:6  </span>And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:7  </span>And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go. 
The Sixth Plague: Boils
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:8  </span>And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:9  </span>And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:10 </span> And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:11 </span> And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:12 </span> And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses. 
The Seventh Plague: Hail
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:13 </span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:14 </span> For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:15 </span> For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:16 </span> And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:17 </span> As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:18 </span> Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:19 </span> Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:20 </span> He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:21 </span> And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:22 </span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:23 </span> And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:24 </span> So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:25 </span> And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:26 </span> Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:27 </span> And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:28 </span> Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:29 </span> And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD'S. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:30 </span> But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:31 </span> And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:32 </span> But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:33 </span> And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:34 </span> And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 9:35 </span> And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses. 

The Eighth Plague: Locusts
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:1 </span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:2 </span> And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:3 </span> And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:4 </span> Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:5 </span> And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:6 </span> And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:7 </span> And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:8 </span> And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:9 </span> And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:10</span>  And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:11</span>  Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:12</span>  And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:13</span>  And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:14</span>  And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:15</span>  For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:16</span>  Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:17</span>  Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:18</span>  And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:19</span>  And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:20</span>  But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go. 
The Ninth Plague: Darkness
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:21</span>  And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:22</span>  And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:23</span>  They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:24</span>  And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:25</span>  And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:26</span>  Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:27</span>  But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:28</span>  And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 10:29</span>  And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more. 

A Final Plague Threatened
<p><span id="charse">Exo 11:1 </span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 11:2 </span> Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 11:3 </span> And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 11:4 </span> And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 11:5 </span> And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 11:6 </span> And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 11:7 </span> But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 11:8 </span> And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 11:9 </span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 11:10</span>  And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land. 

The Passover
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:1 </span> And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:2 </span> This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:3 </span> Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:4 </span> And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:5 </span> Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:6 </span> And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:7 </span> And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:8 </span> And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:9 </span> Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:10</span>  And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:11</span>  And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD'S passover. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:12</span>  For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:13</span>  And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:14</span>  And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:15</span>  Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:16</span>  And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:17</span>  And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:18</span>  In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:19</span>  Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:20</span>  Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:21</span>  Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:22</span>  And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:23</span>  For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:24</span>  And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:25</span>  And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:26</span>  And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:27</span>  That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD'S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:28</span>  And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. 
The Tenth Plague: Death of the Firstborn
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:29</span>  And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:30</span>  And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:31</span>  And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:32</span>  Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also. 
The Exodus
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:33</span>  And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:34</span>  And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:35</span>  And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:36</span>  And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:37</span>  And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:38</span>  And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:39</span>  And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:40</span>  Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:41</span>  And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:42</span>  It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations. 
Institution of the Passover
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:43</span>  And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:44</span>  But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:45</span>  A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:46</span>  In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:47</span>  All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:48</span>  And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:49</span>  One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:50</span>  Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 12:51</span>  And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies. 

Consecration of the Firstborn
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:1 </span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:2 </span> Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine. 
The Feast of Unleavened Bread
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:3 </span> And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:4 </span> This day came ye out in the month Abib. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:5 </span> And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:6 </span> Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:7 </span> Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:8 </span> And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:9 </span> And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD'S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:10</span>  Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:11</span>  And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:12</span>  That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males shall be the LORD'S. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:13</span>  And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:14</span>  And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:15</span>  And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:16</span>  And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt. 
Pillars of Cloud and Fire
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:17</span>  And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:18</span>  But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:19</span>  And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:20</span>  And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:21</span>  And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 13:22</span>  He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people. 

Crossing the Red Sea
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:1 </span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:2 </span> Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:3 </span> For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:4 </span> And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:5 </span> And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:6 </span> And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:7 </span> And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:8 </span> And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:9 </span> But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:10</span>  And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:11</span>  And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:12</span>  Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:13</span>  And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:14</span>  The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:15</span>  And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:16</span>  But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:17</span>  And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:18</span>  And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:19</span>  And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:20</span>  And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:21</span>  And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:22</span>  And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:23</span>  And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:24</span>  And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:25</span>  And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:26</span>  And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:27</span>  And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:28</span>  And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:29</span>  But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:30</span>  Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 14:31</span>  And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses. 

The Song of Moses
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:1 </span> Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:2 </span> The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:3 </span> The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:4 </span> Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:5 </span> The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:6 </span> Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:7 </span> And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:8 </span> And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:9 </span> The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:10</span>  Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:11</span>  Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:12</span>  Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:13</span>  Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:14</span>  The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:15</span>  Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:16</span>  Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:17</span>  Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:18</span>  The LORD shall reign for ever and ever. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:19</span>  For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:20</span>  And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:21</span>  And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. 
Bitter Water Made Sweet
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:22</span>  So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:23</span>  And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:24</span>  And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:25</span>  And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:26</span>  And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 15:27</span>  And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters. 

Bread from Heaven
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:1 </span> And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:2 </span> And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:3 </span> And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:4 </span> Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:5 </span> And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:6 </span> And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:7 </span> And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:8 </span> And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:9 </span> And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:10</span>  And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:11</span>  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:12</span>  I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:13</span>  And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:14</span>  And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:15</span>  And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:16</span>  This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:17</span>  And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:18</span>  And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:19</span>  And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:20</span>  Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:21</span>  And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:22</span>  And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:23</span>  And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:24</span>  And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:25</span>  And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:26</span>  Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:27</span>  And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:28</span>  And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:29</span>  See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:30</span>  So the people rested on the seventh day. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:31</span>  And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:32</span>  And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:33</span>  And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:34</span>  As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:35</span>  And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 16:36</span>  Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah. 

Water from the Rock
<p><span id="charse">Exo 17:1 </span> And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 17:2 </span> Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 17:3 </span> And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 17:4 </span> And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 17:5 </span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 17:6 </span> Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 17:7 </span> And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not? 
Israel Defeats Amalek
<p><span id="charse">Exo 17:8 </span> Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 17:9 </span> And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 17:10</span>  So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 17:11</span>  And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 17:12</span>  But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 17:13</span>  And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 17:14</span>  And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 17:15</span>  And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 17:16</span>  For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation. 

Jethro's Advice
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:1 </span> When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:2 </span> Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:3 </span> And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:4 </span> And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:5 </span> And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:6 </span> And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:7 </span> And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:8 </span> And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:9 </span> And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:10</span>  And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:11</span>  Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:12</span>  And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:13</span>  And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:14</span>  And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:15</span>  And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:16</span>  When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:17</span>  And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:18</span>  Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:19</span>  Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:20</span>  And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:21</span>  Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:22</span>  And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:23</span>  If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:24</span>  So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:25</span>  And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:26</span>  And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 18:27</span>  And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land. 

Israel at Mount Sinai
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:1 </span> In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:2 </span> For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:3 </span> And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:4 </span> Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:5 </span> Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:6 </span> And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:7 </span> And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:8 </span> And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:9 </span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:10</span>  And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:11</span>  And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:12</span>  And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:13</span>  There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:14</span>  And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:15</span>  And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:16</span>  And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:17</span>  And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:18</span>  And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:19</span>  And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:20</span>  And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:21</span>  And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:22</span>  And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:23</span>  And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:24</span>  And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 19:25</span>  So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them. 

The Ten Commandments

<p><span id="charse">Exo 20:4 </span> Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 20:5 </span> Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 20:6 </span> And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

<p><span id="charse">Exo 20:11</span>  For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 20:12</span>  Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

<p><span id="charse">Exo 20:18</span>  And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 20:19</span>  And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 20:20</span>  And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 20:21</span>  And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.

<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:18</span>  And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:19</span>  And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:20</span>  Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:21</span>  And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:22</span>  Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:23</span>  And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the LORD: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:24</span>  And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:25</span>  And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:26</span>  And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy part. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:27</span>  And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:28</span>  And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:29</span>  And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:30</span>  And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:31</span>  And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:32</span>  And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:33</span>  And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:34</span>  And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:35</span>  And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:36</span>  And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:37</span>  Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:38</span>  Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:39</span>  The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:40</span>  And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:41</span>  And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:42</span>  This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:43</span>  And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:44</span>  And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:45</span>  And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 29:46</span>  And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD their God. 

The Altar of Incense
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:1 </span> And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood shalt thou make it. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:2 </span> A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:3 </span> And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:4 </span> And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:5 </span> And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:6 </span> And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:7 </span> And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:8 </span> And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:9 </span> Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:10</span>  And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto the LORD. 
The Census Tax
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:11</span>  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:12</span>  When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:13</span>  This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:14</span>  Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:15</span>  The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:16</span>  And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. 
The Bronze Basin
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:17</span>  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:18</span>  Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:19</span>  For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:20</span>  When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:21</span>  So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations. 
The Anointing Oil and Incense
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:22</span>  Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:23</span>  Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:24</span>  And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:25</span>  And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:26</span>  And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:27</span>  And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:28</span>  And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:29</span>  And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:30</span>  And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:31</span>  And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:32</span>  Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:33</span>  Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:34</span>  And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:35</span>  And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:36</span>  And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:37</span>  And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 30:38</span>  Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people. 

Oholiab and Bezalel
<p><span id="charse">Exo 31:1 </span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 31:2 </span> See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 31:3 </span> And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 31:4 </span> To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 31:5 </span> And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 31:6 </span> And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee; 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 31:7 </span> The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 31:8 </span> And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 31:9 </span> And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 31:10</span>  And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 31:11</span>  And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do. 
The Sabbath
<p><span id="charse">Exo 31:12</span>  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 31:13</span>  Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 31:14</span>  Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 31:15</span>  Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 31:16</span>  Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 31:17</span>  It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 31:18</span>  And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God. 

The Golden Calf
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:1 </span> And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:2 </span> And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:3 </span> And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:4 </span> And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:5 </span> And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:6 </span> And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:7 </span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:8 </span> They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:9 </span> And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:10</span>  Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:11</span>  And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:12</span>  Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:13</span>  Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:14</span>  And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:15</span>  And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:16</span>  And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:17</span>  And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:18</span>  And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:19</span>  And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:20</span>  And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:21</span>  And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them? 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:22</span>  And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:23</span>  For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:24</span>  And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:25</span>  And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:) 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:26</span>  Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD'S side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:27</span>  And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:28</span>  And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:29</span>  For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:30</span>  And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:31</span>  And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:32</span>  Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:33</span>  And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:34</span>  Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 32:35</span>  And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made. 

The Command to Leave Sinai
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:1 </span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:2 </span> And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:3 </span> Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:4 </span> And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:5 </span> For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:6 </span> And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb. 
The Tent of Meeting
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:7 </span> And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:8 </span> And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:9 </span> And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the LORD talked with Moses. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:10</span>  And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:11</span>  And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle. 
Moses' Intercession
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:12</span>  And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:13</span>  Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:14</span>  And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:15</span>  And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:16</span>  For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:17</span>  And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:18</span>  And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:19</span>  And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:20</span>  And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:21</span>  And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:22</span>  And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 33:23</span>  And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen. 

Moses Makes New Tablets
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:1 </span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:2 </span> And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:3 </span> And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:4 </span> And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:5 </span> And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:6 </span> And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:7 </span> Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:8 </span> And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:9 </span> And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance. 
The Covenant Renewed
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:10</span>  And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:11</span>  Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:12</span>  Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:13</span>  But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:14</span>  For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:15</span>  Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:16</span>  And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:17</span>  Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:18</span>  The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:19</span>  All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:20</span>  But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:21</span>  Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:22</span>  And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:23</span>  Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:24</span>  For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:25</span>  Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:26</span>  The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:27</span>  And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:28</span>  And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments. 
The Shining Face of Moses
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:29</span>  And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:30</span>  And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:31</span>  And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:32</span>  And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:33</span>  And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:34</span>  But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 34:35</span>  And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him. 

Sabbath Regulations
<p><span id="charse">Exo 35:1 </span> And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 35:2 </span> Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 35:3 </span> Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day. 
Contributions for the Tabernacle
<p><span id="charse">Exo 35:4 </span> And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,

<p><span id="charse">Exo 35:20</span>  And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 35:21</span>  And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD'S offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 35:22</span>  And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 35:23</span>  And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 35:24</span>  Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD'S offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.

<p><span id="charse">Exo 35:29</span>  The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses. 
Construction of the Tabernacle
<p><span id="charse">Exo 35:30</span>  And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 35:31</span>  And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship; 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 35:32</span>  And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 35:33</span>  And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 35:34</span>  And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 35:35</span>  Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work. 

<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:1 </span> Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:2 </span> And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:3 </span> And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:4 </span> And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made; 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:5 </span> And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:6 </span> And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:7 </span> For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:8 </span> And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:9 </span> The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:10</span>  And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:11</span>  And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:12</span>  Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:13</span>  And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:14</span>  And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:15</span>  The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:16</span>  And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:17</span>  And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:18</span>  And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:19</span>  And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:20</span>  And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up.

<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:22</span>  One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:23</span>  And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:24</span>  And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:25</span>  And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:26</span>  And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:27</span>  And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:28</span>  And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:29</span>  And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:30</span>  And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:31</span>  And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:32</span>  And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:33</span>  And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:34</span>  And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:35</span>  And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:36</span>  And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 36:37</span>  And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;

<p><span id="charse">Exo 37:2 </span> And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 37:3 </span> And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 37:4 </span> And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 37:5 </span> And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 37:6 </span> And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 37:7 </span> And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat; 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 37:8 </span> One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 37:9 </span> And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims.

Materials for the Tabernacle
<p><span id="charse">Exo 38:21</span>  This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 38:22</span>  And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.

Making the Priestly Garments
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:1 </span> And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:2 </span> And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:3 </span> And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:4 </span> They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the two edges was it coupled together. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:5 </span> And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:6 </span> And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:7 </span> And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:8 </span> And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:9 </span> It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:10</span>  And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:11</span>  And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:12</span>  And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:13</span>  And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:14</span>  And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:15</span>  And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work of pure gold. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:16</span>  And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:17</span>  And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:18</span>  And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:19</span>  And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:20</span>  And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:21</span>  And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:22</span>  And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:23</span>  And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:24</span>  And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:25</span>  And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates; 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:26</span>  A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:27</span>  And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:28</span>  And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:29</span>  And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:30</span>  And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:31</span>  And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:32</span>  Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:33</span>  And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:34</span>  And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:35</span>  The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:36</span>  The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:37</span>  The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:38</span>  And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:39</span>  The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:40</span>  The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:41</span>  The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:42</span>  According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 39:43</span>  And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them. 

The Tabernacle Erected
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:1 </span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:2 </span> On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:3 </span> And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:4 </span> And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:5 </span> And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:6 </span> And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:7 </span> And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:8 </span> And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:9 </span> And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:10</span>  And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:11</span>  And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:12</span>  And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:13</span>  And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:14</span>  And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:15</span>  And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:16</span>  Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:17</span>  And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:18</span>  And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:19</span>  And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:20</span>  And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:21</span>  And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:22</span>  And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:23</span>  And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:24</span>  And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:25</span>  And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:26</span>  And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:27</span>  And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:28</span>  And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:29</span>  And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:30</span>  And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:31</span>  And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:32</span>  When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:33</span>  And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work. 
The Glory of the Lord
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:34</span>  Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:35</span>  And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:36</span>  And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys: 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:37</span>  But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up. 
<p><span id="charse">Exo 40:38</span>  For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.

<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:1</span>2  Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:1</span>3  He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.

<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:1</span>5  He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:1</span>6  He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:1</span>7  And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.

<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:1</span>9  Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:2</span>0  Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:2</span>1  Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;

<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:2</span>5  Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:2</span>6  He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:2</span>7  He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:

<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:2</span>9  So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;

<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:3</span>2  For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.

<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:3</span>5  And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.

<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:3</span>7  For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:3</span>8  But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:3</span>9  For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.

<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:4</span>1  Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.

<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:4</span>3  How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan: 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:4</span>4  And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:4</span>5  He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:4</span>6  He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:4</span>7  He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:4</span>8  He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:4</span>9  He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:5</span>0  He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:5</span>1  And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham: 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:5</span>2  But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:5</span>3  And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:5</span>4  And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:5</span>5  He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:5</span>6  Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:5</span>7  But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:5</span>8  For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:5</span>9  When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:6</span>0  So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men; 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:6</span>1  And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:6</span>2  He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:6</span>3  The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:6</span>4  Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:6</span>5  Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:6</span>6  And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:6</span>7  Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:6</span>8  But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:6</span>9  And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:7</span>0  He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:7</span>1  From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. 
<p><span id = "charse">Psa 78:7</span>2  So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
